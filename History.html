<p1 class="abthistory">The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a men's T20 franchise cricket league of India. It is annually
 contested by ten teams based out of seven Indian cities and three Indian states.[1][2] The league was
 founded by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in 2007. Brijesh Patel is the incumbent 
chairman of IPL.[3] It is usually held annually in summer across India between March to May and has 
an exclusive window in the ICC Future Tours Programme.<br>
The IPL is the most-attended cricket league in the world. In 2014, it was ranked sixth by
 average attendance among all sports leagues.[5] In 2010, the IPL became the first sporting event in 
the world to be broadcast live on YouTube.[6][7] The brand value of the IPL in 2022 was ₹90,038 crore 
(US$11 billion).[8] According to BCCI, the 2015 IPL season contributed ₹1,150 crore (US$140 million)to
 the GDP of Indian economy<br>

<h2 style="color:black;">History</h2>
The Indian Cricket League (ICL) was founded in 2007, with funding provided by Zee Entertainment
 Enterprises.[10] The ICL was not recognised by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) or the
 International Cricket Council (ICC) and the BCCI were not pleased with its committee members joining 
the ICL executive board.[11] To prevent players from joining the ICL, the BCCI increased the prize 
money in their own domestic tournaments and also imposed lifetime bans on players joining the ICL,
 which was considered a rebel league by the board<br> <img src="iplimg1.jpg" alt="img not found" width="100%">
On 13 September 2007,[14] on the back of India's victory at the 2007 T20 World Cup,[15] 
BCCI announced a franchise-based Twenty20 cricket competition called Indian Premier League. The
 first season was slated to start in April 2008, in a "high-profile ceremony" in New Delhi. BCCI vice-president
 Lalit Modi, who spearheaded the IPL effort, spelled out the details of the tournament including its format, the prize money,
 franchise revenue system and squad composition rules. It was also revealed that the IPL would be run by a seven-man governing
 council composed of former India players and BCCI officials and that the top two teams of the IPL would qualify for that year's
 Champions League Twenty20. Modi also clarified that they had been working on the idea for two years and that the IPL 
was not started as a "knee-jerk reaction" to the ICL.[14] The league's format was similar to that of the Premier League of
 England and the NBA in the United States<br>
In order to decide the owners for the new league, an auction was held on 24 January 2008 with
 the total base prices of the franchises costing around $400 million.[13] At the end of the auction,
 the winning bidders were announced, as well as the cities the teams would be based in: Bangalore,
 Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Jaipur, Kolkata, Mohali, and Mumbai.[13] In the end, the franchises were
 all sold for a total of $723.59 million.[16] The Indian Cricket League soon folded in 2008.[17]

Players of Pakistan are not allowed to take part in the league since the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks, 
due to the involvement of Pakistan in that attack, 166 people lost their lives and 238 were gravely
 injured. The odious attack widespread angered many Indians, resulting in a total ban of Pakistani 
players in the IPL<br></p1>
